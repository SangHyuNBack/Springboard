Spark has matured to the stage now where for 90% of what you need to do (when analysing tabular data) should be possible with Spark dataframes, SQL, and ML libraries. This is where this exercise is mainly trying to focus.  \n<br>\nFeel free to adapt this exercise to play with other datasets readily availabe in the Databricks enviornment (they are listed in a cell below). \n#####Getting Started\nTo get started you will need to create and attach a databricks spark cluster to this notebook. This notebook was developed on a cluster created with: \n- Databricks Runtime Version 4.0 (includes Apache Spark 2.3.0, Scala 2.11)\n- Python Version 3\n\n#####Links & References\n\nSome useful links and references of sources used in creating this exercise:\n\n**Note**: Right click and open as new tab!\n<br>\n1.
